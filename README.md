<H2>The data are from a website for cooking recipes. The company that owns the website wants to sell subscriptions, and the idea is that if the website receives lots of visits (so traffic is “high”) because of a posted recipe, the likelihood of a subscription sale increases.

Hence the overall objective of this project is to predict which recipes will lead to high traffic.

The raw data set for this project is .recipe_site_traffic_2212.csv  </H2>
